# About Me 

Before transitioning into web and software development, I worked as a team lead in a warewhouse in Port Wentworth, Georgia. While in the industry I found myself enjoying the technical and computer driven aspects of the office which lead me to follow my true passion for front-end and back-end development.

My management position brung a fresh prospective to techincal and leaderships roles as it showcases my detailed oriented and organizational skills in any job I perform.
