# About Me 



I first learned to code at the beginning of 2019 but I literally had no luck with it. I struggled to retain things, and I couldn‚Äôt get things to stick. I could not have hated coding more than I did at the time. 

Not until August 2021 did I ACTUALLY start learning programming and coding in a way that worked for me. After two years of self learning. I've finally knew how to learn coding by trial and error 

Now, I enjoy learning new technologies and new programming languages by making something from scratch step by step as well as working on real-world projects
